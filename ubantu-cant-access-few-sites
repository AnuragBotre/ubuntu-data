THe problem is with MTU size in the network.
If it is greater than 1500 then it won't work.


pppoeconf
On the console or in your terminal session type:


sudo pppoeconf
A text-based menu program will guide you through the next steps, which are:

Confirm that your Ethernet card is detected.
Enter your username (provided by your ISP).
Enter your password (provided by your ISP).
If you already have a PPPoE Connection configured, you will be asked if it may be modified.
Popular options: you are asked if you want the 'noauth' and 'defaultroute' options and to remove 'nodetach' - choose "Yes".
Use peer DNS - choose "Yes".
Limited MSS problem - choose "Yes".
When you are asked if you want to connect at start up, you will probably want to say yes. (This option does not work) See the secton "Connecting on Boot"
Finally you are asked if you want to establish the connection immediately.
Once you have finished these steps, your connection should be working.

Manual connection control
To start your ADSL connection on demand, in a terminal type:
pon dsl-provider


To stop your ADSL connection, in a terminal type:
poff dsl-provider

in most cases, you can just type "poff" to stop the ADSL connection and unload the module.
